# Face-Mask-Detector

Face mask detection has a range of applications from capturing the movement of the face to facial recognition which at first requires the face to be detected with very good precision. Face detection is more relevant today
High precision image classification is now possible with advances in convolutional networks. Pixel level information is often needed after face detection, which most face detection methods do not provide.

Obtaining pixel-level detail has been a difficult part of semantic segmentation. Semantic segmentation is the process of assigning a label to each pixel in the image.

this model can give a prediction of 93% of the images with annotation of maks whether it is there or not
